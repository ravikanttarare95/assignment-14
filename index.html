                    steer thrilling chase</span>
                <img src="./image/india-team-celebrate-their-thi.webp" alt="">
                <p>Despite the stiff challenge posed by New Zealand, India clinched the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 by a
                    four-wicket margin, marking the third time they won this title. Chasing 251 in the final on a tricky
                    surface in Dubai, India were put under pressure both with the bat and ball but they managed to put
                    in a collective effort that saw them get over the line to go through the tournament unbeaten, and
                    add a seventh ICC senior trophy to their cabinet.</p>
                <p>India got off to a rollicking start in the chase led by skipper Rohit Sharma. In a 105-run opening
                    stand, Rohit dominated contributing 69 off 63 and setting the tone early. With the conditions
                    favouring spin, both teams targeted the pacers well with Rohit's assault nearly making a mockery of
                    the chase. The first eight overs bowled by New Zealand's pacers, sans their injured spearhead Matt
                    Henry, saw Rohit race off to 47 in a team score of 59.</p>
                <p>It forced Mitchell Santner to bring himself on but by and large the openers were able to keep the
                    run-rate up even while toning down the aggression. Reaching 106 by 19 overs, India were firmly in
                    the driver's seat before New Zealand pulled things back.</p>
                <p>Santner had Shubman Gill caught splendidly at cover by a leaping Glenn Phillips, who added to his
                    highlights reel of eye-popping catches, while Michael Bracewell struck with his first ball turning
                    one past Virat Kohli's flick to trap him LBW for one. Losing two wickets in the space of four balls
                    put the pressure back on India and New Zealand's spinners began to apply the choke. Even a well-set
                    Rohit had to cut the risks out while Shreyas Iyer settled in.</p>
